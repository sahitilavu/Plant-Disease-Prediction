        'description': 'Apple scab is a disease of Malus trees, such as apple trees, caused by the ascomycete fungus Venturia inaequalis. The disease manifests as dull black or grey-brown lesions on the surface of tree leaves, buds or fruits. Lesions may also appear less frequently on the woody tissues of the tree. Fruits and some vegetative tissues may become deformed or cracked and trees may defoliate prematurely. The disease rarely kills its host, but can significantly reduce fruit yields and fruit quality. Affected fruits are less marketable due to the presence of the black fungal lesions.',

The fungus spends a portion of its life cycle on Eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) and a portion on apple (Malus spp.) or crabapple (Malus spp.) trees. The fungus spends the winter on cedar trees as a reddish-brown gall on the twigs. In the spring, these galls swell and become covered with orange gelatinous tendrils. These tendrils release spores that are carried by the wind to apple or crabapple trees. On apple or crabapple trees, the spores infect the leaves and fruit. The fungus then spends the summer on apple or crabapple trees as a yellowish-brown spot on the leaves or fruit. In the fall, the fungus produces spores that are carried by the wind back to cedar trees to complete the cycle.',

The disease is most severe when temperatures range from 75 to 85 °F (24 to 29 °C) and free moisture is present for 11 to 17 hours per day. The disease is most severe in continuous corn fields, especially when minimum tillage is practiced. The disease is also more severe when corn follows corn in a rotation.
